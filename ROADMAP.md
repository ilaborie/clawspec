# Clawspec Project Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic direction and planned milestones for the Clawspec project. Our goal is to create the most developer-friendly and robust OpenAPI specification generator for Rust applications.

## Vision Statement

**Enable effortless API documentation generation through test-driven development in Rust.**

Clawspec aims to bridge the gap between testing and documentation by automatically generating comprehensive, accurate OpenAPI specifications from your existing test suites. This approach ensures that your API documentation is always up-to-date and reflects the actual behavior of your application.

## Core Principles

- **Test-Driven Documentation**: Generate specs from real API usage, not hand-written schemas
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with minimal setup
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system for compile-time validation
- **Framework Agnostic**: Support multiple web frameworks and use cases
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive APIs with excellent error messages

## Release Milestones
